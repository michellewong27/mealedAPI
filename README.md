Description: Mealed is a recipe scheduling application to spice up the everyday personâ€™s routine meals by enabling users to search recipe ideas and schedule it on their own personal calendar to block out time in their day to make the dish. Each user can share their own recipes they have up their sleeve with the community, add items to their grocery list that they need to make a note to buy later on, and favorite other recipes.

Technologies/ Frameworks Used: For the frontend, this application implemented React coupled with CSS to design a functional user interface. Mealed integrated the Spoonacular API to pull and parse recipe data in addition to conducting a Rails backend to have users craft their own recipe data. Material UI was employed for the date/time capabilities when scheduling a new recipe to put on the calendar. React Big Calendar was applied to allow users to have a calendar layout with the recipes visualized in an organized structure.

Frontend is located here: https://github.com/michellewong27/MealedApp
